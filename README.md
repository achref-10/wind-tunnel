# 🌬️ Wind Tunnel Simulation for EV Aerodynamic Study

This project is part of our electric vehicle (EV) research. It simulates real aerodynamic conditions using a custom wind tunnel. The embedded system controls wind flow using a timed relay and measures the effect of wind on a scaled EV model using weight sensors.

This repository documents the **embedded control system**, developed using **Arduino** and a **Multifunction Trigger Delay Time Relay Module**.

## 🎯 Objective

- Simulate aerodynamic conditions to study airflow behavior on an EV model.
- Control wind flow duration using a timed relay module.
- Measure aerodynamic force in real time with load sensors.
- Display results on an LCD screen for immediate analysis.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

### 🧠 Controller: Arduino UNO

Responsible for:
- Reading data from **2 load cells** via **HX711 modules**
- Sending real-time data to an **LCD display**
- (Optional) Managing fan speed via **PWM** if needed

### 🌀 Wind Generation

- Controlled by a **Multifunction Trigger Delay Time Relay Module**
- The module allows for precise activation timing (e.g., delay + run duration)
- A **DC fan** is powered through the relay to simulate wind

### ⚖️ Force Measurement

- Two **load cells** are placed beneath the EV model
- Forces are converted to digital values using **HX711 modules**
- Results are averaged and displayed in grams or Newtons

### 📺 Display

- A **16x2 I2C LCD** shows:
  - Live aerodynamic force
  - Wind test status (running/stopped)
  - Optional: Timer countdown or test cycle info

## 🔁 Working Principle

1. The operator sets the desired delay and run time on the relay module.
2. The module activates the fan after the delay and runs it for the configured time.
3. During fan activation, the Arduino reads force values from the sensors.
4. Data is displayed in real time on the LCD screen.
